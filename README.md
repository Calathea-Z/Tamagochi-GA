This is a simple game where the user keeps their dog alive by clicking buttons.

User Stories: 
1.When I open the webpage I see some information and can click a button to start the game. 
2. I arrive at the next page and I see a character select page where I can choose between 3 different dogs and also choose a name for my dog. I can click another button to start the game.
3. I am taken to the game page where the dog I chose is moving around the screen. I need to click on the dog icon to "play" with my dog. There are also two other buttons; one for feeding my dog and one for letting my dog sleep by "turning of the lights".
4. Over time the dog's hunger, boredom, and sleepiness level increase. These levels increase at different rates. 
5. I can click on both the boredom and hunger buttons at anytime to lower those levels, however I can only click on the lights off button to reduce sleepiness after my dogs's level has reached 6 or greater. 
6. If any of the dog's levels get to 10 then I loose the game and the game over screen appears. 
7. I can then choose to quit the game or I can click to play again. 
8. There is a high score tracker at the bottom of the game screen that updates if the score of my most current game is the highest recorded. 

Technologies: 
To make this project work I learned about CSS animations, how to que up audio clips through the DOM, how to style CSS text-shadow, and how to store information in localStorage so that the information can be shared throughout a website.
