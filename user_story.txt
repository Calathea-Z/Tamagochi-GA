User Story:

1. The user arrives at a slash web page that asks if they would like to begin the game. 
2. The user is taken to a second webpage where they get to choose their Tomagochi (and name it )out of 3 choices. 
(It would be cool if each Tomagochi had a difficult level - We shall see.)

3. 
    - The user is taken to a 4th page with the game environment. On screen they see metrics in the top of Hunger, Boredom, Sleepiness, Age.
    - Hunger, Boredom, & Sleepiness rise based on certain things:
        Hunger - Rise based on Time Passed in general.
        Boredom - Rise based on a random number. 
        Sleepiness - Rise based on intervals of a certain amount of time. (ie. - every 2 minutes )

    - Age goes up every minute. 

    - There will be buttons on this page where you can turn of the lights if the pet is too tired. If you don't turn of the lights within 10 seconds - you will lose. If sleep button is chosen the pet will rest and that meter will reset. 

    -There will be buttons to feed pet to lower hunger meter. 
    -There will be buttons to play with bet to lower boredom meter. 

    If any of the bars drop to zero your pet goes to Tamagochi heaven.
